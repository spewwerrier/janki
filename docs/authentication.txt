- On register we generate new unique id on the server and save it on database
  - insert into session (cookie_string, references(select id from users where name = username))
  - unique id = id hash + username

- We send that unique id to the client

- Client saves it as a cookie
  - cookie['id'] = unique_id

- When user creates a knob
  - take the cookie['id'] and check if its in database
    - user_id = select users(id) from session where cookie_string = cookie['id']
    - if not exists then redirect to a login page
  - save the knob
    - insert into knob_descriptions (user_id, time)
    - insert into knob ( references(knob_description), details...)
